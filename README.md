# Building Support for Efficient Calculations across Large Datasets in MetPy

#### 11th Symposium on Advances in Modeling and Analysis Using Python

#### 101st American Meteorological Society Annual Meeting, January 2021

Here you will find the scripts I used to generate graphs of performance for Quantity-wrapped numpy arrays versus Quantity-wrapped Dask Arrays in MetPy. These examples are for illustration only and do not represent an overall efficient workflow that should be used in real applications.
